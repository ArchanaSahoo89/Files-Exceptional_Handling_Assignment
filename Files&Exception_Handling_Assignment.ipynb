        "# Importance of Exception Handling in Concurrent Programs\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Stability and Reliability:\n",
        "# Unhandled exceptions in a thread or process can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. If one part of a concurrent program fails, it may compromise the entire application, leading to data corruption or loss of functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Debugging and Maintenance:\n",
        "# Properly handling exceptions allows for better logging and debugging. When exceptions are caught and logged, developers can understand what went wrong and where, making it easier to diagnose issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Resource Management:\n",
        "# Concurrent programs often manage shared resources (like files, databases, or network connections). If an exception occurs and is not handled, resources may remain locked or unfreed, leading to leaks or deadlocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Graceful Degradation:\n",
        "# Exception handling enables programs to fail gracefully. Instead of crashing, a program can handle the error, report it, and continue running other parts of the system, improving user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. Data Integrity:\n",
        "# In concurrent applications, maintaining data integrity is crucial. Handling exceptions ensures that transactions or critical operations can be rolled back or compensated appropriately.\n",

        "# Techniques for Handling Exceptions in Concurrent Programs\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Try-Except Blocks\n",

        "# 3. Thread or Process-Specific Exception Logging\n",
        "# Implement logging mechanisms that log exceptions specific to each thread or process, allowing for easier tracking of issues in concurrent environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Using Futures and Callbacks\n",
